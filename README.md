# BREATHE #

Resources are not always available and accessible, but Breathe can provide online aid to anyone with the internet. In this day and age during COVID-19, there is an increase in isolation and loneliness which may lead to the development of mental health issues.

Surprisingly, mental health guidance also became less available and it is harder for people to get the help they need instantly. We came up with Breathe to provide instant aid for individuals that need to self-regulate their breathing or mental health in case of emergencies when they cannot seek professional help. We hope for this app to help people in need that cannot find the professional assistance they need.

Deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress in the body. This is because when we breathe deeply, it sends a message to the brain to calm down and relax. Breathing deeply slows down the release of cortisol, a stress hormone. Stress heightens the symptoms of anxiety and depression, which is why breathing is said to help with this. With breathe, you can now have a guided breathing session and improve your overall mental well-being.

### What's next for BREATHE? ###
a mobile app for Breathe, as well as partnering with existing mental health and wellness foundations to seek advice on improvements to the applications that will benefit people in need of it. We also plan on adding more features such as sharing data, and an AI that is able to detect breathing audio and recognize the frequency of the user's breathing and prompting them to breath faster or slower to obtain a regular breathing rate.
